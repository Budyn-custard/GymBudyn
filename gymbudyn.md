# 🏋️‍♂️ GymBudyn — MVP Specification & Status

## 💡 Overview
**GymBudyn** is a mobile workout logging app built with **React Native (Expo)**.  
The MVP will run **fully offline**, storing data locally (e.g., AsyncStorage or SQLite).  
All architecture decisions should make it easy to later add a **.NET 10 Web API backend** and sync features.

Goal: A friendly gym companion that lets users log workouts, track progress, and build custom templates — no clutter, just functionality.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage (or SQLite for structured data)
